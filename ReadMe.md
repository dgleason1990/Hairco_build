When starting this program up you must check to see if the URLs are to heroku or to localhost:8080.
In the case that they are set to https://hairco.herokuapp.com you must switch to http://localhost:8080.
    **Suggestion is to use the search bar to find and replace URLs**

Headers are also ignored and not available on Github. To see how the application runs please refer to
